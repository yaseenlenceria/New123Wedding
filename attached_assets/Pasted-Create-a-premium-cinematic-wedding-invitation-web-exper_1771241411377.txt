Create a premium cinematic wedding invitation web experience builder.

This is NOT a simple template.
This must feel like a luxury wedding film in web format.

The user is a bride or groom with zero design skills.
Everything must feel magical, smooth and effortless.

Do not restrict creativity.
Unlock full animation and storytelling potential.

CORE EXPERIENCE FLOW

Opening Scene – Luxury Envelope Animation

• Show a textured paper envelope centered on screen.
• Add a realistic wax seal with two gold rings embossed.
• On tap or scroll, the wax seal gently cracks.
• Envelope flaps open smoothly with depth and soft shadows.
• Background music begins softly.
• A subtle golden light glow appears as it opens.

This should feel emotional, cinematic and slow — not fast or mechanical.

Hero Section – Romantic Reveal

• As envelope opens, wedding photo fades in.
• Elegant script headline appears with smooth fade + upward motion.
• Rings appear in background slightly blurred.
• Rings move slowly in floating parallax motion.
• Text stays crisp and readable.
• Soft particles or light dust float subtly.

Make it feel like luxury perfume ad level quality.

Scroll Behaviour – Ring Leads the Story

The ring is a storytelling element.

• As user scrolls, ring gently floats left and right.
• Ring subtly rotates with scroll direction.
• Ring moves slightly ahead of content.
• It acts as a “guide” to the next section.
• Motion must be elegant, slow, smooth.
• Never distracting.

Each section transition should feel like a chapter in a love story.

Section Structure (Every Template Must Have)

Each template must include:

• Opening envelope animation
• Hero with couple photo
• Countdown section (live animated)
• Event timeline section
• Venue with maps
• Details (dress code, transport, accommodation)
• Gallery
• Wedding registry
• RSVP form
• Thank you ending screen

Each section must animate into view.
Nothing should just appear suddenly.

Scroll Experience

• Use cinematic scroll storytelling.
• Background images move slower than text.
• Soft fade transitions.
• Gentle zoom on images.
• Ring continues subtle parallax.
• Section titles animate letter by letter.

Make it feel like Apple product page level smoothness.

RSVP Interaction

• RSVP button should glow softly.
• When clicked, form slides up elegantly.
• Form fields animate one by one.
• Submission gives soft success animation.
• Confetti animation optional but subtle.

Music Player

• Floating minimal music control.
• Auto-play disabled by default.
• When pressed, rings subtly pulse to music rhythm.

Language Switch

• Language toggle with small elegant flag icons.
• Text transitions smoothly when language changes.

Template Builder Dashboard

Create a very simple, beautiful dashboard for users.

User flow:

• Choose template style
• Upload photos
• Enter names, date, venue
• Add timeline
• Add registry link
• Add music link
• Customize colors
• Customize fonts
• Preview live instantly

The dashboard must feel modern, clean, minimal.
No clutter.
No technical complexity.

Animation Quality Requirements

• All animations must feel premium.
• No cheap bounce effects.
• No harsh transitions.
• Everything smooth and slow.
• Use easing that feels romantic and luxurious.
• Focus on emotion.

Visual Direction

Templates should include:

• Sage green luxury
• Champagne gold elegance
• Ivory and cream minimal
• Black and gold royal
• Dusty rose romantic

Every template must keep the same core structure but different style.

Mobile First

This must feel incredible on mobile.
All animations optimized for vertical scroll.
Envelope animation must work perfectly on phone.

Now let me explain how the ring effect you described works in simple terms:

The reason it looks so beautiful is because:

• Ring is on its own animation layer.
• It has slow floating movement.
• It responds slightly to scroll position.
• It moves slower than text.
• It uses blur + depth effect.
• It has subtle rotation.

That combination makes it feel alive.

You want cinematic scroll storytelling.

That’s what makes it viral.
